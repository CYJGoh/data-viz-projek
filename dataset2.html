                The stacked bar chart above shows the percentage of students who passed and failed the Portuguese exam by their weekend alcohol consumption. It can be noticed that students who have very low alcohol consumption on weekends have the highest percentage
                of students passing the Portuguese exam. On the other hand, students with very high alcohol consumption on weekends have the highest percentage of students failing the Portuguese exam.

                    and 84.91 of them have access to the Internet. Almost 70% of the students are not in a romantic relationship who passed the Math exam. It also can be noticed that extra paid classes outside of school have little effect on the students
                    passing the Math exam.

                    The stacked bar chart above shows the percentage of students who failed the Portuguese exam by 6 different factors that may affect their academic performance. It can be seen that the top 2 factors contributing to the students failing the Portuguese exam
                    are students without school support, with 82% of them, and students without extra paid classes outside of school, with 91% of them. This could mean that the two factors contribute to the students failing their Portuguese exam.

                    The stacked bar chart above shows the percentage of students who passed the Portuguese exam by 6 different factors that may affect their academic performance. It can be seen that the top 2 factors contributing to the students failing the Portuguese exam
                    are students without extra paid classes outside of school, with 94.54% of them, and students without school support, with 89.07% of them. One possible reason why there are so many students who could pass the Portuguese exam without
                    extra paid classes outside of school is that Portuguese is the mother tongue of these students. Hence, even without extra classes, the students can still pass the exam. It can also be seen that 64.85% of the students who passed the
                    exam are not in a romantic relationship. This can mean that the students have more time to focus on their Portuguese studies.
