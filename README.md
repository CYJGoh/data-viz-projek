# Background and Motivation
Data visualisation on the effect of the factors that may affect students’ academic performance can be useful for multiple different stakeholders which are the school management, the policymakers as well as the parents of the students. These stakeholders are the users of this data visualisation project. This visualisation can serve as a tool for all the users to quickly overview the factors that have a substantial impact on the students’ academic performance. After identifying the different factors that affect the academic performance of students, proactive measures can be taken to address these factors and ultimately, enhance the students’ academic performance in school.  
<br>
The motivation of the project is to understand the influence of multiple factors such as parents’ educational background, availability of lunch and student interaction behaviours on students’ academic performance in various subjects. 

# Visualisation Purpose
The visualisations produced in this project shall assist the users effectively to answer the following questions: 
* Does parental education background affect student’s grades? 
* Do the differences in the student’s lunch affect the student’s academic performance? 
* Do students study more when they have more free time? 
* Do students who have more free time and spent more time studying fail in any exams? 
* Do more interactive students score higher grades than less interactive students? 
* How can students’ alcohol consumption affect the exam grades? 
* What are the factors that affects prominently on the students’ exam grades? 

# Data Source
For this project, the datasets that will be used are about students’ academic performance which are sourced from Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository. The available URLs for these datasets are shown in the list below: 

* Dataset 1 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams 
* Dataset 2 - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance  
* Dataset 3 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data 
<br>
The collected data will be in Excel comma-separated value files (CSV), and will be processed and cleaned, if necessary, before being used in the further stages of the project for visualisation which will utilize libraries such as D3, Chart.js, and Highcharts. <br>
<br>
The collected data also has various associated attributes such as nominal data like students’ nationality, gender, race or ethnicity, place of birth, educational stages, type of lunch students get, and more. Other than that, there are also numeric data such as number of times student raised hands in classrooms, number of times students visited course resources, student exam scores, and more.
